Should I just store the filereader pointer in fluidsimulator
make for loops more efficient
filereader should check if all registered parameters have been read in
in the case of inflow do we assume 0 tangential velocity? as there is no parameter defined for passing it from the parameter file
include direction of flow in border values
do something about error when declaring border velocity variable but not filling it
warning for variables not found in parameter file
multigrid solver for p
